Both apache spark and hadoop are different tools used for processing of BigData.
SPARK overcomes the performance issues with HADOOP.
SPARK- It is a open source cluster computing framework.
HADOOP undergoes the Batch processing whereas SPARK undergoes real-time data processing with huge data and as well as batch processing in the same framework.
SPARK  processes 10 times and upto 100 times faster than HADOOP.
SPARK has less code and HADOOP uses JAVA which has more lines of code.
There is a spark core component which controls everything.
It controls SPARK SQL-SPARK streaming-MLib-GraphX
SPARK specially deals with Data Frames.

SPARK Architecture:
Driver which has SPARK context splits the data to workers which has executor and assigns the task to them.

SPARK mainly deals with the following key words:
     -->RDD(Resilient distributed data sets)-which is the core components and which can be re-constructed during the failure.
     -->Data Frames-SQL,MLib (Databases and machine learning algorithms)
     -->Dstreams-it is a SPARK streaming API.

SPARK Lifecycle:
   -->Load data on cluster
   -->Create RDD
   -->Do transformation
   -->Perform action
   -->Create Data Frame
   -->Perform queries on Data Frame
   -->We can run SQL queries on Data Frames
CAN SPARK REPLACE HADOOP?
   Even the HADOOP and SPARK can process the data without depending on each other, say HADOOP can process by the MapReduce functions(Batch processing),
   and SPARK can process the data from external cloud storage, still SPARK can be used above the HADOOP and SPARK is specially designed for HADOOP.

ADVANTAGES OF SPARK OVER HADOOP:
SPEED-->10 times and upto 100 times faster in usage of in-memory processing.
MEMORY--> SPARK uses memory where as HADOOP uses local storage(HARD DISK).
RDD--> SPARK uses RDD for fault rewcovery using lineage whereas HADOOP uses replication of data.
STREAMING--> SPARK performs a real time processing of data.
API-->SPARK supports multiple data sources and multiple languages.
